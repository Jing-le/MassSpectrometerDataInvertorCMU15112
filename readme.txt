15-122 Term Project - Mass Spectrometer Data Invertor
By Jing Lin

Description: 
    Project takes in data files of voltage data from the Jen lab mass
spectrometers and converts them into data points for graphing. To do this, it 
uses specific parameters that the user inputs to output the correct information.
The graph is a scatterplot which has several features built in to improve the 
use of viewing its data.

Instructions:
    To run the program, start on the "IntroScreen" file. Also, take note of the
files that are titled "data" and "time". Once running, make sure to input the 
files in the data input section on the bottom right. Files must be inputted
exactly or program won't run. They also need to be the corresponding ones with
each other.

Libraries: None

Shortcuts:
    Program doesn't have any shortcuts because it doesn't need any. I have
included a instruction tab on the graphing page so you know what features it has
